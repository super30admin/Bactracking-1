## Problem1 
Combination Sum (https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
Example 1:

Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
Example 2:

Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]

## Problem2
Expression Add Operators(https://leetcode.com/problems/expression-add-operators/)

Given a string that contains only digits 0-9 and a target value, return all possibilities to add binary operators (not unary) +, -, or * between the digits so they evaluate to the target value.

Example 1:

Input: num = "123", target = 6
Output: ["1+2+3", "1*2*3"] 
Example 2:

Input: num = "232", target = 8
Output: ["2*3+2", "2+3*2"]
Example 3:

Input: num = "105", target = 5
Output: ["1*0+5","10-5"]
Example 4:

Input: num = "00", target = 0
Output: ["0+0", "0-0", "0*0"]
Example 5:

Input: num = "3456237490", target = 9191
Output: []
